## INTRODUCTION TO SMART SWIMMING POOL
Swimming pools are a popular source of recreation, but ensuring the safety of 
swimmers and maintaining optimal water quality are crucial concerns. This 
project introduces the IoT-based Smart Swimming Pool Monitoring System, 
designed to enhance safety and water quality management. 
Situated in Rwanda, this system leverages state-of-the-art technology to provide a 
safer and more enjoyable swimming experience.
The primary objective is to improve swimming pool safety, water quality, and 
operational efficiency by integrating IoT technology. This system features a 
wearable monitoring device equipped with heartbeat sensors and vibrator motor connected to ESP8266 and underwater system equipped with PH,water temperature  connected to ESP8266  and ESP8266 to send to data on cloud later on database and dashboard  that continuously collect real-time data, 
monitoring both water conditions and swimmers' well-being.
At its core, the system relies on IoT connectivity. An ESP8266 module, integrated 
into the wearable device and underwater system , facilitates real-time data collection and secure 
underwater Wi-Fi communication for transmitting data to a cloud-based platform. 
This cloud platform, integrated with the thinkspeak Cloud and database even dashboard, serves as the hub for 
data storage, analysis, and visualization.
Users, including pool operators and authorities, access the cloud platform 
through dashboard . Real-time data visualization, historical 
analysis, and customizable alerts empower users to make informed decisions. 
Alerts can be configured to trigger when predefined thresholds for pH, 
temperature, or irregular heartbeats are exceeded, enabling proactive 
interventions

 ## Objectives
 1. Water Quality Monitoring:
Develop a robust IoT-based system capable of continuous and real-time monitoring and maintenance of swimming pool water quality, 
ensuring it consistently meets established safety and hygiene standards.
2. Swimmer Safety:
Implement an integrated real-time heartbeat monitoring system using wearable devices or underwater sensors to promptly detect irregularities in swimmers' heart rates and enhance their safety while swimming.
3. Data Analytics and Reporting:
Employ advanced data analytics algorithms to process the collected data, generating insights, trends, and real-time reporting for pool operators and relevant authorities, enabling data-driven decision-making.
## CIRCUITLY SYSTEM WORKING PRINCIPLE üíº

## Overview
The IoT-based Smart Swimming Pool Monitoring System is designed to enhance the safety and water quality of swimming pools through real-time monitoring and data analysis. This system integrates wearable technology for swimmers and an underwater monitoring system, both connected via IoT technology to a cloud-based platform for data storage and analysis.

## System Components
## Wearable Monitoring Device

### Heartbeat Sensor: Monitors the swimmer's heart rate.
### Vibrator Motor: Provides haptic feedback to the swimmer in case of abnormal heart rate detection.
### ESP8266 Module: Facilitates wireless communication and data transmission.
## Underwater Monitoring System

### pH Sensor: Measures the acidity/alkalinity of the pool water.
### Water Temperature Sensor: Monitors the temperature of the pool water.
### ESP8266 Module: Facilitates wireless communication and data transmission.
## Cloud-Based Platform

### ThingSpeak Cloud: Collects and stores data from the ESP8266 modules.
### Database: Manages historical data and supports data retrieval.
### Dashboard: Provides real-time data visualization and alerts.
Data Flow and Connectivity
## Data Collection:

The wearable device continuously monitors the swimmer's heartbeat and sends the data via the ESP8266 module.
The underwater system continuously measures pH and water temperature, sending this data via its ESP8266 module.
##Data Transmission:

Both ESP8266 modules use secure Wi-Fi communication to transmit the collected data to the ThingSpeak Cloud platform.
## Cloud Processing:

The ThingSpeak Cloud platform receives the data and stores it in a centralized database.
Real-time data and historical data are processed and analyzed on the cloud.
## Data Visualization and Alerts:

The cloud platform is integrated with a dashboard that pool operators and authorities can access.
The dashboard visualizes real-time data, historical trends, and analysis results.
Users can set customizable alert thresholds for pH levels, water temperature, and heartbeat rates.
Alerts are generated and sent to users when the collected data exceeds these predefined thresholds, enabling timely interventions.
Proactive Interventions
## Safety Alerts: If the heartbeat sensor detects an irregular heart rate, an immediate alert is sent to the pool operator, and the vibrator motor provides haptic feedback to the swimmer, prompting them to leave the pool if necessary.
Water Quality Alerts: If the pH level or water temperature goes beyond safe limits, alerts are triggered, allowing pool operators to take corrective actions such as adjusting chemical levels or temperature settings.
